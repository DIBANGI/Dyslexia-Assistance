# Dyslexia-Assistance
I developed a prototype to assist individuals with dyslexia by enabling seamless conversion between text and speech. The software is designed to make reading and communication easier by converting written text into spoken words and vice versa. Built using Python, the system leverages the SpeechRecognition module for accurate speech-to-text conversion and a text-to-speech engine to deliver clear audio feedback. This project aims to enhance accessibility and improve the daily experiences of dyslexic users by providing a user-friendly interface and essential features.
